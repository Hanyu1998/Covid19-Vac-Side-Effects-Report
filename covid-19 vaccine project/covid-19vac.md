# Overview

For this project, we explored reported side effects of the covid-19 vaccine, focusing on adverse reactions reported from 2020-12-01 to   2021-3-31. The visualization aims to provide an insight into who are the people reporting side effects and how do they compare to the general population; the most common reported symptoms etc. We also analyzed tweets associated with the covid-19 vaccine to see people's attitudes on the vaccine.

# Who Are the People Reporting Side Effects ? 

## Age and Gender

### Do elders suffer more from side effects ? Not exactly


```r
vac <- read_csv("covidvacdata/2021VAERSDATA.csv")
sym <- read_csv("covidvacdata/2021VAERSSYMPTOMS.csv")
vax <- read_csv("covidvacdata/2021VAERSVAX.csv")

#convert vaccination date
vac$VAX_DATE <- as.Date(vac$VAX_DATE, format = "%m/%d/%Y") 

#merge the first two csv file by patient ID
merge1 <- left_join(vac, sym, by = "VAERS_ID")
#merge the third csv together
merge <- left_join(merge1, vax, by = "VAERS_ID")

#filter for COVID19 vaccine
covid <- merge %>% 
  filter(VAX_TYPE == "COVID19")

#find out patient's age and gender
agesex <- covid %>% 
  distinct(VAERS_ID,.keep_all = TRUE) %>% #distinct patients
  select(AGE_YRS, SEX, VAX_DATE) %>% 
  filter(AGE_YRS >= 18 & AGE_YRS != 'NA', VAX_DATE >= "2020-12-01" & SEX != "U" ) #filter for age over 18, vaccination data after 2020-12-01 and filter out unknown value for sex

  group_by(SEX,AGE_YRS) %>%

We could see that in general, women and younger people seem to suffer more from side effects. As age increased, the report number actually decreased, especially for women. Do elders suffer more from side effects? Not exactly.
Is it possible there are fewer elders who got vaccinated thus fewer reports? We decided to dive deeper into who got vaccinated by looking at different age groups. 

### Vaccinated rate by different age group

agegroup <- read_csv("covidvacdata/demographic_trends_of_people_receiving_covid19_vaccinations_in_the_united_states.csv")

ageg <- agegroup %>% 
  filter(Date <= "2021-03-31") %>% #filter for date before 2021/03/31
  filter(`Age Group` != "Age_unknown" & `Age Group` != "Age_known" & `Age Group` != "Ages_<18yrs") %>%  #filter for age > 18
  select(Date, `Age Group`, `People with at least one dose`, `Percent of age group with at least one dose`, Census)

ageg$Age <- with(ageg, ifelse(`Age Group` == "Ages_18-29_yrs", "18-29",
                              ifelse(`Age Group` == "Ages_30-39_yrs", "30-39",

By mar31,2021, for people over 75 years old, fewer than 3 of every 10,000 people who received at least one dose of COVID-19, reported adverse effects. In contrast, those aged 30 to 39 reported the highest rate of adverse effects, at 6 out of every 10, 000 people who received the vaccine.
So, counter-intuitively, it seems that elders are less vulnerable to side effects. Some articles suggest that the immune response may actually be stronger in the younger group, so side effects may be more pronounced for the younger. The results of our data seem to confirm this.
However, there may be other reasons for the lower rate of reported side effects in the elderly group, such as the elderly group is not as likely to use computers as the younger group, which affects the reporting rate, etc

## Pre-illness

Medical history and Pre-illness are also strong indicators to predict suitable candidates for covid-19 vaccines. So we decided to look at the most common pre-illness of these people who reported adverse reactions.


```r
his <- vac %>% 
  filter(AGE_YRS >= 18 & AGE_YRS != 'NA', VAX_DATE >= "2020-12-01" & SEX != "U" ) %>% #filter for age >18 , vaccination data after 2020-12-01 and filter out unknown value for sex
  filter(HISTORY != "None" & HISTORY != "NA" & HISTORY !="N/A" & HISTORY != "n/a" & HISTORY !="no" & HISTORY != "none") %>% 
  select(VAERS_ID,HISTORY) %>% 
  rename(doc_id = VAERS_ID, text = HISTORY) 

#cleaning
new_stops <- c("no", "history","medical", "conditions", "historyconcurrent", "disease","patient", "relevant","chronic","none", stopwords("en"))

his$text <- iconv(his$text, "UTF-8", "UTF-8",sub='')
his$text = removePunctuation(his$text)
his$text=tolower(his$text)
his$text=removeWords(his$text, new_stops)
his$text=removeNumbers(his$text)
  
require(RWeka)
# Make tokenizer function 
tokenizer <- function(x) 
  NGramTokenizer(x, Weka_control(min = 1, max = 3))

hisd <- data.frame("history" = tokenizer(his$text))
hisd <- hisd %>% 
  group_by(history) %>% 
  count(history) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) 
#write.csv(hisd, "/Users/hannahz/Desktop/data visualization\\history.csv")
#after counting, I manually filtered most common 50 pre-illness. I combind the same illness (hypertension, high blood pressure)
history <- read_csv("covidvacdata/pre-illness_history_clean.csv")

purple_orange <- brewer.pal(10, "RdYlBu")
set.seed(2103)
wordcloud(history$history, history$n,
         max.words = 50, colors = purple_orange)
```

Hypertension, asthma, and diabetes are the most common pre-illness mentioned by people reporting side effects. 
One thought is that respondents with those diseases might be more vulnerable to vaccine side effects. However, Is it possible that those symptoms reported are actually caused by pre-illness but rather than vaccines?  People might associate health problems that would have happened anyway with the vaccines. We haven't come up with a more accurate way to describe this relationship but it is worth exploring.

# When Did Side Effects Kick in ? 


```r
nums <- vac %>% 
  filter(AGE_YRS >= 18 & AGE_YRS != 'NA', VAX_DATE >= "2020-12-01" & SEX != "U" & NUMDAYS != "NA") %>%
  select(SEX,AGE_YRS,NUMDAYS) 

nums$group <- with(nums, ifelse(AGE_YRS >= 18 & AGE_YRS <= 29, "18-29",
                              ifelse(AGE_YRS >= 30 & AGE_YRS <= 39, "30-39",
                                            ifelse(AGE_YRS >= 40 & AGE_YRS <= 49, "40-49",
                                                   ifelse(AGE_YRS >= 50 & AGE_YRS <= 64, "50-64",
                                                          ifelse(AGE_YRS >= 65 & AGE_YRS <= 74, "65-74",
                                                                 ifelse(AGE_YRS >= 75, "75+", "other")))))))

numbyages <- nums %>% 
  group_by(SEX,group) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(NUMDAYS))


ggplot(numbyages, aes(x = group, y = mean, fill = SEX)) + geom_col(position = "dodge", width = 0.6) + labs(title = "Side Effects Average Onset Days After Vaccination", x ="Age", y = "Number of Days after Vaccination") +

In general, the younger group seems to be more sensitive about side effects; they reported symptoms under 3 days after vaccination. Elders tend to be slower in feeling the symptoms.  Side effects tend to kick in early for males in the younger group. In the elder group, on the contrary, females seem to suffer earlier from the symptoms.

Negative, disgust, fear, sadness are the most frequently expressed emotions in the symptoms text, which is reasonable because people were experiencing uncomfortable feelings in their bodies.
