Covid19 Vaccine Side Effects Report

For this project, I explored reported side effects of the covid-19 vaccine, focusing on adverse reactions reported from 2020-12-01 to 2021-3-31. The visualization aims to provide an insight into who are the people reporting side effects and how do they compare to the general population; the most common reported symptoms etc.
